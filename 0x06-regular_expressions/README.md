# 0x06 Regular Expression

This repository contains solutions for the Regular Expression project of the ALX System Engineering & DevOps curriculum.

## Description

Regular expressions, often abbreviated as "regex" or "regexp", are a powerful tool used in various programming languages and text processing utilities to search, manipulate, and validate strings based on patterns.

This project focuses on understanding and applying regular expressions in the context of tasks and challenges.

## Files

- **0-simply_match_school.rb**: A Ruby script that accepts one argument and uses a regular expression to match the word "School" in the provided string. It demonstrates basic usage of regular expressions in Ruby.
- **1-repetition_token_0.rb**: A Ruby script that accepts one argument and uses a regular expression to match repetition tokens in the provided string.
- **2-repetition_token_1.rb**: A Ruby script that accepts one argument and uses a regular expression to match repetition tokens in the provided string.
- **3-repetition_token_2.rb**: A Ruby script that accepts one argument and uses a regular expression to match repetition tokens in the provided string.
- **4-repetition_token_3.rb**: A Ruby script that accepts one argument and uses a regular expression to match repetition tokens in the provided string.
- **5-beginning_and_end.rb**: A Ruby script that accepts one argument and uses a regular expression to match strings that start with "h" and end with "n", with any single character in between.
- **6-phone_number.rb**: A Ruby script that accepts one argument and uses a regular expression to match a 10-digit phone number.
- **7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb**: A Ruby script that accepts one argument and uses a regular expression to match only capital letters in the provided string.
