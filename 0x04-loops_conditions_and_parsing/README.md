## Introduction

In the field of DevOps, effective scripting is crucial for automation and efficient system management. This module concentrates on fundamental concepts such as loops, conditions, and parsing in the Bash scripting language. Whether you are a beginner or looking to sharpen your scripting skills, this repository provides practical examples and exercises to solidify your understanding.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this module, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of DevOps concepts
- Familiarity with the Bash scripting language
- Access to a Unix-like operating system (Linux preferred)

## Features

- **Loops:** Learn how to use loops for repetitive tasks and iterate through data structures.
- **Conditions:** Explore conditional statements to make decisions in your scripts.
- **Parsing:** Understand parsing techniques for processing and extracting information from data.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x04-Loops-Conditions-Parsing.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 0x04-Loops-Conditions-Parsing
   ```

3. Explore the scripts and examples provided in each section.

## Examples

### Loops

```bash
# Example of a for loop
for i in {1..5}
do
  echo "Iteration $i"
done
```

### Conditions

```bash
# Example of an if statement
if [ "$1" -gt 10 ]
then
  echo "Input is greater than 10."
else
  echo "Input is less than or equal to 10."
fi
```

### Parsing

```bash
# Example of parsing a CSV file
while IFS=, read -r name age city
do
  echo "Name: $name, Age: $age, City: $city"
done < data.csv
```
